# Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict loan approval outcomes and assess the risk associated with each loan application. Using a dataset of 20,000 loan applications with 36 features, the model evaluates financial, demographic, and credit factors to predict loan approval and classify applicants based on risk.

## Features of the Dataset
The dataset contains the following 36 features:

- **Demographic Information**: Age, Marital Status, Education Level, Number of Dependents  
- **Financial Information**: Annual Income, Loan Amount, Credit Score, Monthly Debt Payments  
- **Credit History**: Bankruptcy History, Previous Loan Defaults, Payment History, Credit Card Utilization  
- **Other Factors**: Home Ownership Status, Job Tenure, Length of Credit History, etc.

## Model Used
**Machine Learning Models**:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting
- AdaBoost
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Results
The project achieved an accuracy of up to **99%** in predicting loan approvals and assessing risk, with detailed classification reports available for each model used.

| Random Forest                   | 99.01%         |
| Decision Tree                   | 98.73%         |
| Gradient Boosting               | 99.70%         |
| AdaBoost                        | 99.88%         |
| Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)    | 99.94%         |

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in financial risk assessment and loan approval prediction, aiding in data-driven decision-making for financial institutions.
