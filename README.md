Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict loan approval outcomes and assess the risk associated with each loan application. Using a dataset of 20,000 loan applications with 36 features, the model evaluates financial, demographic, and credit factors to predict loan approval and classify applicants based on risk.

Features of the Dataset
The dataset contains the following 36 features:

Demographic information: Age, Marital Status, Education Level, Number of Dependents
Financial information: Annual Income, Loan Amount, Credit Score, Monthly Debt Payments
Credit History: Bankruptcy History, Previous Loan Defaults, Payment History, Credit Card Utilization
Other factors: Home Ownership Status, Job Tenure, Length of Credit History, etc.
Model Used
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting
AdaBoost
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Results
The project achieved an accuracy of up to 99% in predicting loan approvals and assessing risk, with detailed classification reports available for each model used.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in financial risk assessment and loan approval prediction, aiding in data-driven decision-making for financial institutions.
